          <h3>Here's His Artworks from the silent movie maker</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1918–1922: First National</strong></li>
            <p>In January 1918, Chaplin was visited by leading British singer and comedian Harry Lauder, and the two acted in a short film together.</p>
            <li><strong>1923–1938: Silent features</strong></li>
            <p>Having fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer. In November 1922, he began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers.</p>
            <li><strong>1953–1977: European years</strong></li>
            <p>Chaplin did not attempt to return to the United States after his re-entry permit was revoked, and instead sent his wife to settle his affairs. The couple decided to settle in Switzerland and, in January 1953, the family moved into their permanent home: Manoir de Ban.</p>
            <li><strong>Final works and renewed appreciation</strong></li>
            <p>In the last two decades of his career, Chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights. In an interview he granted in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still "room for the Little Man in the atomic age". The first of these re-releases was <em>The Chaplin Revue</em> (1959), which included new versions of <em>A Dog's Life, Shoulder Arms, and The Pilgrim</em>.</p>
            <li><strong>Death</strong></li>
            <p>By October 1977, Chaplin's health had declined to the point that he needed constant care. In the early morning of 25 December 1977, Chaplin died at home after suffering a stroke in his sleep. He was 88 years old. The funeral, on 27 December, was a small and private Anglican ceremony, according to his wishes.</p>

          <p>"In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, and has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed."</p>
